# drinkup

## Running

The app includes a live-reloading static server on port `8080`,
which will build, launch, and rebuild the app whenever you change application code.
To start the server, run:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

If you prefer to just build without the live reload and build-on-each-change watcher, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
